# MarkLang Development Report

## Initial Setup
- The project began with a focus on translating blog post titles and descriptions from one language to another using a predefined translation model and API.
- The initial implementation included functions for translating titles and descriptions, cleaning frontmatter values, and validating frontmatter structure.

## Enhancements

### 1. Clean Frontmatter Logic
- Integrated the `clean_frontmatter_value` function to ensure all frontmatter values are properly formatted before being written to the output file.

### 2. Support for Arrays (Tags and Categories)
- Added support for translating arrays such as `tags` and `categories`.
- Each string in these arrays is translated individually and integrated into the frontmatter.

### 3. Improved Translation Context
- Modified the `translate_array` function to batch multiple items into a single prompt for better context.
- This change addressed issues where single-word inputs resulted in gibberish translations due to lack of context.

### 4. Error Handling for Arrays
- Enhanced the `translate_array` function to validate input types and ensure all elements are strings.
- Added checks to verify the length of the translated array matches the input array, with error logging and placeholder responses for invalid cases.

### 5. Regeneration Logic
- Implemented logic to regenerate translations if the input array is invalid or if the translated array length does not match the input array.

## Current State
- The `process_markdown` function now supports translating titles, descriptions, tags, and categories.
- All translated content is validated and written to an output file with clean and properly formatted frontmatter.
- Error handling ensures robustness, and invalid inputs are logged with appropriate error messages.

## Example Usage
- The `process_markdown` function can be used to process a markdown file and generate a translated version with updated frontmatter.

```python
process_markdown("example.md")
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional frontmatter fields.
- Optimize API calls for better performance.
- Implement unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

## 15 / 05 - Today's Achievements

### 1. CLI Refactor and Language Flexibility
- Refactored the script to be fully CLI-based, allowing users to specify input/output files, source and target languages, and translation model.
- Output file paths are now automatically generated based on the target language directory.

### 2. Custom Dictionary Support
- Implemented per-language custom dictionary CSVs (e.g., `translations_hi.csv`, `translations_fr.csv`) for tags and categories.
- The script checks the custom dictionary first for each tag/category before using Google Translate or transliteration.

### 3. Robust Fallbacks for Tags/Categories
- If Google Translate fails, the script now uses offline transliteration (e.g., Devanagari for Hindi, Thai script for Thai) for technical terms and proper nouns.
- Ensured all tags/categories are always treated as arrays and properly transliterated or translated.

### 4. Logging and Error Handling
- Added extensive logging for all major steps, including dictionary loading, translation, and file operations.
- Improved error handling for missing dependencies, invalid frontmatter, and translation failures.

### 5. Production-Readiness
- Modularized and documented the code for maintainability.
- Added type hints, docstrings, and improved CLI/UX for real-world use.

### 6. Example Custom Dictionary Files
- Created sample `translations_hi.csv` and `translations_fr.csv` for Hindi and French, supporting easy extension to other languages.

These changes make MarkLang more robust, flexible, and ready for production and collaborative use.
