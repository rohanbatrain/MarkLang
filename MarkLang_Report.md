# MarkLang Development Report

## Initial Setup
- The project began with a focus on translating blog post titles and descriptions from one language to another using a predefined translation model and API.
- The initial implementation included functions for translating titles and descriptions, cleaning frontmatter values, and validating frontmatter structure.

## Enhancements

### 1. Clean Frontmatter Logic
- Integrated the `clean_frontmatter_value` function to ensure all frontmatter values are properly formatted before being written to the output file.

### 2. Support for Arrays (Tags and Categories)
- Added support for translating arrays such as `tags` and `categories`.
- Each string in these arrays is translated individually and integrated into the frontmatter.

### 3. Improved Translation Context
- Modified the `translate_array` function to batch multiple items into a single prompt for better context.
- This change addressed issues where single-word inputs resulted in gibberish translations due to lack of context.

### 4. Error Handling for Arrays
- Enhanced the `translate_array` function to validate input types and ensure all elements are strings.
- Added checks to verify the length of the translated array matches the input array, with error logging and placeholder responses for invalid cases.

### 5. Regeneration Logic
- Implemented logic to regenerate translations if the input array is invalid or if the translated array length does not match the input array.

## Current State
- The `process_markdown` function now supports translating titles, descriptions, tags, and categories.
- All translated content is validated and written to an output file with clean and properly formatted frontmatter.
- Error handling ensures robustness, and invalid inputs are logged with appropriate error messages.

## Example Usage
- The `process_markdown` function can be used to process a markdown file and generate a translated version with updated frontmatter.

```python
process_markdown("example.md")
```

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional frontmatter fields.
- Optimize API calls for better performance.
- Implement unit tests to ensure reliability and correctness.
